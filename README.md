# PixelSimulation

This is a very simple material simulation using pixels. <br>
Based on a [GDC talk](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025695/Exploring-the-Tech-and-Design "	Exploring the Tech and Design of 'Noita'"). <br><br>
The simulation is aimed to contain:
- **Sand** like simulations
- Settling **Liquid** simulation
- Rising **Gas** simulations
- Simulations interacting with each-other

Stacks used:
- Java
- JavaFX
